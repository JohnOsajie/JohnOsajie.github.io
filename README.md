Vanderbilt University, 27 -- cs + econ

Hi, I’m John, a sophomore at Vanderbilt University, majoring in Computer Science and Economics. I love solving problems, coding, exploring new tech, and diving into the world of tech and finance. When I’m not working on projects or doing a stockpile of HOMEWORK, you’ll find me ice skating, playing basketball, or just hanging out with friends.
